# integration-front-end

This website was created as a final project for Netcentric Computing at Seattle Pacific University. It acts as a book database where a user can View, Add, Update, and Remove a book from a database.

This repository is the front end of a full-stack project using a Node.js Express framework. It is built around a RESTful API architecture.

NOTE: Please expect a short delay when first starting up the website as it is loaded through a Heroku dyno. Also expect a short delay the first time the database is accessed.
